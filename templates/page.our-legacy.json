More than anything, the boots are what we know best, and the stories they inspired in the Pacific Northwest.<br\/><br\/>Bootmaking was hard living, but it was honest. A bootmaker only made money when he made a boot, still true to this day. Repairing boots kept the lights on, but it would never buy the building, and Edward knew it. He soon taught his son, John, who continued to work in the Northeast. In 1880, John followed opportunity to the Shenandoah Valley. It was the first time loggers and miners experienced early versions of the White’s work boot. The Blue Ridge Mountains served as a field test for the untested mountains out west, and John used every opportuanity to prepare his boots for the top.<br\/><br\/>The next 20 years were the most important for the success of White’s Boots in the early 20th century. John taught his son, Otto, who would soon show his worth as an innovator of the trade. Otto was ambitious. He wanted to own a building, and he would do it by the 1920s. The more boots he made, the more he began to master the ‘Anatomy of a Legend’ many know and love today: the hand-welted work boot. It’s impossible to know how many bootmakers were practicing the same techniques in those days, but it would be Otto who put his name to the staying power of the hand-sewn work boot in America. He would do it his own way.<br\/><br\/>In 1889, the future of the business rested on John’s shoulders. He decided to move the family out west, bootjacks and all. Otto was not yet 20, but he was already marching toward the Arch-Ease innovation he would trademark in Spokane, WA. All he needed was to experience a place where men had the kind of money to buy the kind of boots he made. In 1900, the family got off the train in Wardner, Idaho. John and Otto set up shop, and one by one, the White family name was stamped into the best work boot in the country.<\/p>"

            "text": "<p>Despite the legacy of the Lineman and Logger and Packer, the longevity of White’s Boots in the 21st century comes down to one boot: the Smokejumper. In 1939, the first version of Smokejumper was worn by Francis Lufkin, an employee of the U.S. Forest Service. As a field tester and foreman for the Smokejumping program, he would become a legend in his own right. He heard about Otto White from his grandfather, who had been a log driver in St. Maries during the logging boom. In the midst of the Great Depression, Francis bought his first pair of White’s Boots for $12.00. The rest is history. No company has benefited more from word-of-mouth than White’s Boots, and the Smokejumper is the chief benefactor of it. One-by-one, smokejumpers started buying the historic 335 model.<\/p><p>In 1951, dealer catalogs touted the 335 as the official boot worn by smokejumpers in Region 1. The U.S. Forest Service never issued the boot as a part of their official gear, but smokejumpers bought it anyway for a week’s worth of pay. The historic Smokejumper was worn for more than 25 years. Hundreds of smokejumpers had worn it and hung it on their mantel as a trophy, but in 1963, Vibram introduced their revolutionary sole into North America and Otto’s bootmakers were there to use it.<\/p><p>Over the next several decades, the 1963 model of the Smokejumper put White’s Boots on more than a map of the Pacific Northwest. It spread to all of North America and beyond. The Smokejumper was key to the success of the company after Otto died in 1972. By no means the only boot sold, but always the best selling, the Smokejumper is known as more than a boot for smokejumpers. They deserve the credit for wearing it and naming it, but the longevity of the Smokejumper is rooted in the 375 and 400 models Otto developed on the 4811 last in 1930. For 91 years and counting, everyone from a logger to a lineman to a farmer to a forest ranger has worn some version of it. Hand-lasted, hand-welted, and hand-bottomed, it’s a legend no matter who wears it.<\/p>",
